#iOS OpenWeather App#

Whether is a SwiftUI app that accesses OpenWeather and builds weather views that can contains SceneKit particle effects for rain, snow, and mist conditions.

Eventually I want to include OpenWeather paid API, and a WatchKit target for WatchOS.

Uses:
    - SwiftUI
    - URLSession
    - Combine
    - Task / Swift Concurrency
    - SceneKit
    - UIKit
